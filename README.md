# tipCal

Tip calculate project, sorry i did not make a walk thought gif, i put all information in readme

so this project are almost the same as the one in the video, diff is I add a control screen, and there are two button here.
if you click one of them, the last tip percentage will change.
etc: original percentage is 15% 18% 20%
if you change, it will become : 15% 18% 25% or something
